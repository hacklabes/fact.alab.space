FACTLab and the [Object Liberation Front](http://olf.space/) present: Ob\_ject and Ob\_serve.

This is the first exhibition by a group of artists, technologists and researchers, loosely working under the name Object Liberation Front, who get together to discuss non-anthropocentric possibilities for concepts like Artificial Intelligence, and their implication to the social imaginary.

Given the complex relationships that humans have nowadays with both “natural” systems (as evidenced by global warming), and engineered systems (internet as surveillance), we have been confronted into imagining a world without humans. Or, at least, a world where the division between humans and nonhumans, as well as divisions between nature and culture, sciences and humanities, matter and thought, don’t make as much sense as they used to.

The works in this exhibition explore different languages for revealing the desires, memories and inner conversations of objects and non-human phenomena, in an attempt to understand how they shape the construction of their own worlds, and in turn, ours.

Alex Pearl will present work that looks at the relationship between breakdown in machines and people. Radamés Ajna and Thiago Hersan will present ongoing work that deals with the secret lives of our communication technologies. Sam Skinner will present a constellation of text-based prints and ephemera drawn from his research of the old Liverpool Observatory.
